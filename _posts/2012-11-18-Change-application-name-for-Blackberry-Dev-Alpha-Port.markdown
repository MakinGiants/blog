Be carefully, If you have already install an application in the device you have to reboot it to make it take the new names... (I don't like that... but it cost me a lot of ours)<br /><br />Don't waist time changing manifest values...<br />Only change the <i>app_name</i> in <i>res/values/string.xml,</i> reboot and ... :)<br /><br />
