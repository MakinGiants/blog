1. Just need to copy the next file on your `app/` or the module that you want to have the coverage:

{% gist danielgomezrico/36609a2204cc2f4e1201 %}

1. Apply the plugin:

{% highlight groovy %}

apply from: "jacoco.gradle"

{% endhighlight %}

1. Run the tests you want (check reporting group on gradle tasks for available ones), in my case I have `release` buildType
   and `mocked` so I have:

{% highlight bash %}

$ ./gradlew testMockedReleaseUnitTestCoverage

{% endhighlight %}

1. Then find the results on `build/reports/jacoco/`
