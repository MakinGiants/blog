You can use [Better Touch Tool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/) to liberate form all day things creating your commands for commands.

Applied to Xcode and iOS develop process there are some tasks that you do all the day...
In the image you will se:

1. `cmd + shift + A`: to show assistant editor (Assistant/Standar)
2. `alt + control + ,`: to hide/show left bar (Navigation View)
3. `alt + control + .`: to hide/show bottom bar (Debug Area)
4. `alt + control + -`: to hide/show right bar (Utilities and Inspector view)

Then you will use xcode easy.

If you want this setup you can import it with this [File](/assets/BetterTouchTool-Developer.btt) and change it for your easy use.
