Env:
- My router: TL-WR940N.
- Net Virtua Router: C6500_57_r18.

You need to:

- Disable all firewall and proteccions on NetVirtua Router.
- Enable all firewall on your router.
- Disable Wifi on NetVirtua Router.
- Enable ipv6 dhcp services on your router.
- Connect from ethernet in NetVirtua router port to wan port on your router.
- Reboot/Restart both routers if none of this setup work and try other thing :P.

PD: Do not try to call Net Virtua, they will not help you with this since "its your router" and you need to pay some guy to setup it (WTF Net Virtua? Por que?).
